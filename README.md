# grey-relational-analysis

- Grey System theory aims to provide theory, techniques, notions, and ideas for resolving (analyzing) latent and intricate systems
- It studies problems with small samples and poor information that are difficult for probability and fuzzy mathematics to handle, usually with partially known, inaccurate or incomplete information.

## What is Grey Relational Analysis?
- Grey relation analysis finds the absolute point-to-point distance between different cases and tries to minimize uncertainty in distances
- The main goal of GRA is to find the n similar metrics from reference metric based on the grey relational grade (GRG) and regressing the prediction of fault-proneness based on the n metrics.
- Grey relational coefficient (GRC) and grey relational grade (GRG) measure the absolute distance between reference projects and comparative projects via GRA

## What kinds of problems this method solves?
- feature subset selection, heterogeneity of data sets, outlier analysis, and fault prediction
